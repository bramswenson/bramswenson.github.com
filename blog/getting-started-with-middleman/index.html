                <p>In this post I will be documenting the process and tools by which I have created and deployed this blog.
Most of my blogging activities will relate to technical subjects like software engineering.
With that in mind here are the requirements I have set forth for this blog platform:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use stuff I already have and know</li>
<li>Github Flavored Markdown Support</li>
<li>Easy to edit posts via text editor</li>
<li>Primary storage in git repo(s)</li>
<li>Static output deployed to github pages</li>
<li>Smart template, script and asset support</li>
<li>Modular design open to customization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Starting middleman with HTML5 Boilerplate</h2>

<p>Installing middleman is as simple as <code>gem install middleman</code>.
Following the instructions found in the middleman documentation I initialized a new html5 project.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>middleman init cia_blog --template html5 --rack
</pre></div>
<p>This results in a directory with a new middleman project. The files found in this directory follow:</p>

<h2>Customizing the middleman configuration</h2>

<p>Since middleman has a modular design and allows extensions, there has to be a way to hook in all those extensions.
At this point I don&#39;t know the details of extension development with middleman.
However it is clear that extensions and middleman itself are all configured through the <code>config.rb</code> file.
The generated version of this file has a basic configuration and allot of helpful comments.
After reading all the comments I removed them and everything that wasn&#39;t explicitly set already and added a simple helper which I&#39;ll use in some later cleanup efforts.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">helpers</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">title</span>
    <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="s1">&#39;shellcaster.com&#39;</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:css_dir</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="s1">&#39;css&#39;</span>
<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:js_dir</span><span class="p">,</span>     <span class="s1">&#39;js&#39;</span>
<span class="n">set</span> <span class="ss">:images_dir</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;img&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>First Iteratation</h2>

<p>Now that I had the configuration in place I decided I want to see the fruit of my efforts.
Part of the utility of middleman is that it provides things like this for us.
With a call simple <code>middleman</code> on my shell the middleman was standing watch.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ middleman</span>
<span class="o">==</span> The Middleman is <span class="nv">loading</span>
<span class="o">==</span> The Middleman is standing watch at http://0.0.0.0:4567
</pre></div>
<p>After firing up my browser and navigating to http://localhost:4567 I was greeted with &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; from the HTML5 Boilerplate template.
I noticed quickly that the title in my browser was &ldquo;HTML5 Boilerplate&rdquo;.
This was the default provided from the layout generated via my <code>middleman init</code> and would need to be modified.
The initial layout file is placed at <code>source/layouts/layout.erb</code> making use of the &ldquo;implicit extensions&rdquo; feature in middleman.
I&#39;m not a huge fan of this kind of implict behavior so I renamed the layout to <code>source/layouts/layout.html.erb</code>.
When I opened <code>source/layouts/layout.html.erb</code> file I found the code setting the title as so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">&lt;title&gt;Getting Started With Middleman Blog&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Which I promptly changed to use the helper I added to <code>config.rb</code> earlier:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">&lt;title&gt;Getting Started With Middleman Blog&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After refreshing my browser a few time and checking that cache was disabled for development I realized I must have missed something as the title remained unchanged.</p>

<h2>Frontmatter</h2>

<p>Since I was on the index page of the site I decided to take a look at the <code>sources/index.html.erb</code> file.
It had an interesting bit of text at the top that appeared to be yaml. Here is the entire file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">title</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">HTML5 Boilerplate Middleman</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">&lt;!-- Add your site or application content here --&gt;</span>
<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">&lt;p&gt;Hello world! This is HTML5 Boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That bit of code at the top is in fact yaml and is called <em>Frontmatter</em> in middleman parlance.
It allows one to specify data related to each page, such as in this case the &ldquo;title&rdquo;.
Since my helper has a fallback for when there is no title I decided to just remove the frontmatter from the index file all together to test the helper.
The helper worked as expected and my title was displayed as shellcaster.com.
I went ahead and added the frontmatter back to the index and changed the page to ensure the helper was available inside my nested index template.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">---</span>
<span class="x">title: Index</span>
<span class="x">---</span>

<span class="x">&lt;h4&gt;</span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x">&lt;/h4&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This worked perfectly, and I was satisfied with my progress. I was however already sick of refreshing my browser manually.</p>

<h2>Livereload and middleman</h2>

<p>Yet again middleman has an extension to help called <code>middleman-livereload</code> which I added to my bundle and updated.
To use this extension I added the following bits to my <code>config.rb</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">activate</span> <span class="ss">:livereload</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">host</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;127.0.0.1&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After restarting the middleman server I knew things were going well since the output changed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">==</span> The Middleman is <span class="nv">loading</span>
<span class="o">==</span> LiveReload is waiting <span class="k">for </span>a browser to <span class="nv">connect</span>
<span class="o">==</span> The Middleman is standing watch at http://0.0.0.0:4567
</pre></div>
<p>To test it I focused the tab with my developement site open in my browser, then wrote the index template to disk.
Boom, the browser reloaded on its own.
This may require the LiveReload browser extension as well, but I&#39;m not 100% sure.
I already had it installed, but <code>middleman-livereload</code> makes use of <code>rack-livereload</code> which I believe injects the needed scripts into the page upon serving it.
If it doesn&#39;t work for you, try installing the Livereload browser plugin.</p>

<h2>Built-in view helpers</h2>

<p>There are allot of view helpers included with middleman.
These are similar to view helpers found in rails or sinatra.
If I recall correctly middleman makes use of view helpers from the padrino project, which is an extension of sinatra.</p>

<p>One of the first things I noticed when looking at the generated layout is that it was quite a mess.
Nothing unneeded save a few comments but quite cluttered to my eyes that have been spoiled with partials and the like.
The good news is that middleman has all the common view helpers I&#39;m used to. Here are a few examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/normalize.css&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/main.css&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;script src=&quot;js/vendor/modernizr-2.6.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

<span class="x">&lt;!-- changed to --&gt;</span>

<span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">stylesheet_link_tag</span> <span class="s1">&#39;normalize&#39;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">stylesheet_link_tag</span> <span class="s1">&#39;main&#39;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">javascript_include_tag</span> <span class="s1">&#39;vendor/modernizr-2.6.2.min&#39;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">&lt;script src=&quot;js/vendor/jquery-1.9.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;script src=&quot;js/plugins.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;script src=&quot;js/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

<span class="x">&lt;!-- changed to --&gt;</span>

<span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">javascript_include_tag</span> <span class="s2">&quot;vendor/jquery-1.9.1.min&quot;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">javascript_include_tag</span> <span class="s2">&quot;plugins&quot;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">javascript_include_tag</span> <span class="s2">&quot;main&quot;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Careful readers will notice I updated jquery and modernizr in the process.
Finally there was a chunk of javascript at the bottom of the layout that will be familiar to anyone who has used Google Analytics.
I&#39;ll be using them for sure, but I&#39;ll also be using other services in experimentation.
I also don&#39;t like chunks of javascript laying around directly in my layouts.
In this case I just extracted the javascript into its own file, converted to coffee.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">&lt;!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site&#39;s ID. --&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;script&gt;</span>
<span class="x">    var _gaq=[[&#39;_setAccount&#39;,&#39;UA-XXXXX-X&#39;],[&#39;_trackPageview&#39;]];</span>
<span class="x">    (function(d,t){var g=d.createElement(t),s=d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];</span>
<span class="x">    g.src=(&#39;https:&#39;==location.protocol?&#39;//ssl&#39;:&#39;//www&#39;)+&#39;.google-analytics.com/ga.js&#39;;</span>
<span class="x">    s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s)}(document,&#39;script&#39;));</span>
<span class="x">&lt;/script&gt;</span>

<span class="x">&lt;!-- converted to --&gt;</span>

<span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">javascript_include_tag</span> <span class="s2">&quot;analytics&quot;</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Setting up the middleman-blog extension</h2>

<p>Since I am going to be using this site primarily as a blog I included the <code>middleman-blog</code> gem in my <code>Gemfile</code> and updated my bundle.
After looking at the documentation I decided I wanted to adjust the default blog paths for both the url and the file system.
<code>middleman-blog</code> supports this with a few adjustments of the <code>config.rb</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">activate</span> <span class="ss">:blog</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tag_template</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;tag.html&quot;</span>           <span class="c1"># Default tag_template setting</span>
  <span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">calendar_template</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;calendar.html&quot;</span> <span class="c1"># Default calendar_template setting</span>
  <span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prefix</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;blog&quot;</span>                     <span class="c1"># Set the prefix for all blog entries to /blog</span>
  <span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">permalink</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;:title/index.html&quot;</span>     <span class="c1"># Slash seperate the permalink and reduce the clutter</span>
  <span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sources</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;:title/index.html&quot;</span>       <span class="c1"># Slash seperate the file system path</span>
  <span class="n">blog</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">default_extension</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;.md.erb&quot;</span>       <span class="c1"># I don&#39;t want to type markdown everytime</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Next I created the nested directories and moved the file in which I had been writing this post into place:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>mkdir -p <span class="nb">source</span>/blog/getting-started-with-middleman
mv <span class="nb">source</span>/test_post.html.md.erb <span class="nb">source</span>/blog/getting-started-with-middleman/index.html.md.erb
</pre></div>
<p>Notice I also added the <code>.erb</code> extension so that Sprockets will process this file through ERB before markdown.
I&#39;ll use it eventually to be sure, so I want it as a default.
I also added the default tag.html and calendar.html files from the middleman-blog repo since I didn&#39;t install it the traditional way and they were not added to my project automatically.</p>

<p>By this time livereload had triggered I had been given a stack trace.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>NoMethodError at /blog/getting-started-with-middleman/
undefined method <span class="sb">`</span><span class="o">[]</span><span class="err">&#39;</span> <span class="k">for </span>nil:NilClass
Ruby  /home/shadowshell/Projects/bramswenson/cia_blog/.bundle/bundle/ruby/1.9.1/gems/maruku-0.6.1/lib/maruku/input/parse_span_better.rb: in read_inline_code, line 528
Web GET localhost/blog/getting-started-with-middleman/
</pre></div>
<h2>Github Flavored Markdown</h2>

<p>After a bit of digging I found that the default markdown processor in middleman, <code>maruku</code> did not like my use of &ldquo;Github Flavored Markdown&rdquo;.
Because I use github so much I&#39;ve grown very accustomed to using their &ldquo;Github Flavored Markdown&rdquo; and fancy syntax highlighting.
It turns out that there is a middleman extension for just that called <code>middleman-syntax</code>.
It adds support for <code>pygments</code> via <code>redcarpet</code> which combined give us both markdown parsing and fancy syntax highlighting.
Next I added <code>middleman-syntax</code> and <code>redcarpet</code> to the <code>Gemfile</code> and updated my bundle.
Adding a few bits to the <code>config.rb</code> file to configure these extensions is in order:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">activate</span> <span class="ss">:syntax</span>
<span class="n">set</span>      <span class="ss">:markdown_engine</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:redcarpet</span>
<span class="n">set</span>      <span class="ss">:markdown</span><span class="p">,</span>        <span class="ss">smartypants</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fenced_code_blocks</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
</pre></div>
<p>After a reload in the browser things were looking well.
I now was able to see my blog post complete with markdown support how I like.
It was finally time to get this thing deployed and on the interwebz.</p>

<h2>Deploying to github pages</h2>

<p>As I said, I use github for a number of things.
For now I&#39;m going to deploy my static site to my personal github pages.
Thanks to the work of others there is a nice middleman extension just for deploying with rsync or git.
Its aptly called <code>middleman-deploy</code> and after adding it to my <code>Gemfile</code> I added the following to my <code>config.rb</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">activate</span> <span class="ss">:deploy</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">deploy</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">deploy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">method</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">:git</span>
  <span class="n">deploy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">remote</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;git@github.com:bramswenson/bramswenson.github.com.git&#39;</span>
  <span class="n">deploy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">branch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;master&#39;</span> <span class="c1"># &#39;gh-pages&#39; is the default for project pages</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And finally to actully deploy my blog I ran the provided cli interface for <code>middleman-deploy</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>middleman build
middleman deploy
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>middleman build</code> command built my site from <code>source/</code> into <code>build/</code>.
The <code>middleman deploy</code> command then used my github settings to push the <code>build/</code> directory to my github repo at git://github.com/bramswenson/ bramswenson.github.com.
After loading up my github page at http://bramswenson.github.com I found my new site in all its glory (or lack there of).</p>

<h2>Custom domains on github via CNAME</h2>

<p>This wasn&#39;t quite enough though, as I wanted this site to be found at http://shellcaster.com/.
Github supports this by adding a simple file called <code>CNAME</code> in the root of your pages repo.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>shellcaster.com
</pre></div>
<p>Of course I also created a A record for my domain pointing to the IP address for <code>bramswenson.github.com</code> as described in the github pages documentation.
After doing another build and deploy and waiting about 10 minutes everything worked and resulted in some form of what you see before you now!
I must say, middleman is pretty slick and makes me feel right at home as a rubyist.
I look forward to learning more about it and sharing that knowledge with you.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for my blog here: http://github.com/bramswenson/cia_blog
In my next post I cover a few more details about middleman and get some styles in place.</p>

<p>Till next time,</p>

<p>Bram.</p>
